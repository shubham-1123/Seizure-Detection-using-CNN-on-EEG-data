# Seizure-Detection-using-CNN-on-EEG-data
Electroencephalogram(EEG) benchmark dataset Chb-mit is used for seizure detection. The CHB-MIT  dataset is a publicly available database that contains data from 24 patients. Each patient has many seizure and non-seizure recording files in European data format (.edf). The majority of EEG signals are recorded using 23 channels at a sampling rate of 256 Hz. These signals also contain noise. So EEG signals must be preprocessed before being analysed. A Butter-Worth bandpass filter for removal of undesired noise and various artefacts, where low cut-off frequency is considered as 0.5Hz and high cut-off frequency is considered as 30Hz. EEG signals are segmented into images of window size of 1 sec.And CNN model is applied onto segmented images and the model is trained and tested on four parameters: accuracy , sensitivity , specificity and f1-score.
Model is trained and tested for Chb_02 , chb_03 , chb_08 patients.
